Rep: Thanks for meeting today! What challenges are you facing with your current CRM system?  
Prospect: We're struggling with lead tracking and visibility across our sales team. It’s chaotic.  
Rep: I see. What specific features are you missing that would help streamline this?  
Prospect: We need better reporting and integration with our marketing tools.  
Rep: Got it. What impact would improved visibility have on your team’s performance?  
Prospect: It’d help us close deals faster and improve forecasting accuracy.  
Rep: That sounds crucial. Are there any budget constraints we should consider?  
Prospect: We have flexibility, but I need to justify the ROI to the CFO.  
Rep: Understood. How does your current solution compare with what we offer?  
Prospect: We’ve looked at a couple of options, but they seem too complicated.
