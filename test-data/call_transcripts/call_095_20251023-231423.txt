Rep: Thanks for connecting today. What led you to explore new CRM solutions right now?  
Prospect: Our current system isn’t scaling with our growth; it’s hard to track leads effectively.  
Rep: That’s a common challenge. What specific features are you looking for in a new CRM?  
Prospect: We need better reporting and integration with our marketing tools.  
Rep: Understood. What would a successful implementation look like for you?  
Prospect: If we could increase lead conversion by 20% in the next quarter, that’d be great.  
Rep: Any budget constraints we should consider?  
Prospect: We have a budget of around $20,000, but we need to see a solid ROI.  
Rep: That’s helpful. Are you also considering competitors like Salesforce or HubSpot?  
Prospect: Yes, but we’re concerned about their complexity and costs.  
Rep: Our platform offers simplicity and scalability. Would a demo next week work for you?  
Prospect: Yes, I’d like to see how it integrates with our tools.  
Rep: Great! I’ll send a calendar invite for Tuesday and include a demo agenda.
