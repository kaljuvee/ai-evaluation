Rep: Thanks for connecting today! What’s driving your search for a new CRM solution?

Prospect: Our current system is too clunky and isn’t syncing well with our marketing tools.

Rep: I see. How are you currently managing leads and sales tracking?

Prospect: It’s mostly manual, and we’re missing follow-ups. It’s frustrating.

Rep: Understood. What would an ideal CRM help you achieve in the next quarter?

Prospect: Seamless integration with our marketing platform and better sales visibility. 

Rep: Any budget constraints I should keep in mind?

Prospect: We have a budget of $20,000 for this year, but we need to see clear ROI.

Rep: That’s helpful. Have you evaluated any competitors?

Prospect: We looked at Salesforce but found it too expensive.

Rep: Our solution offers robust features at a fraction of the cost. Any hesitations about switching?

Prospect: Data migration and training are my main concerns.

Rep: We offer dedicated support for migration and training. Would a pilot in one department work for you?

Prospect: Yes, let’s start there. 

Rep: I’ll send over a proposal and schedule a follow-up next week.
