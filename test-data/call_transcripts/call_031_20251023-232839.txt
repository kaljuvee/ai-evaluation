Rep: Thanks for connecting today. What’s driving your search for a new CRM solution?  
Prospect: Our current system isn’t scaling with our sales team, and we’re losing leads.  
Rep: I understand. What specific pain points are you experiencing?  
Prospect: Too many manual processes and poor visibility into the pipeline.  
Rep: If we could automate those processes and provide real-time insights, what would that mean for your team?  
Prospect: It would boost productivity and help us close deals faster.  
Rep: Are there any budget constraints we should be aware of?  
Prospect: We have a budget set, but I need to justify ROI to the CFO.  
Rep: Understood. How do you currently track ROI on sales tools?  
Prospect: We use spreadsheets, but it’s cumbersome and outdated.  
Rep: Our CRM integrates analytics to streamline that. Any concerns about switching systems?  
Prospect: Just the time it takes to train the team.  
Rep: We offer a dedicated onboarding program. How about a demo next week?  
Prospect: Sounds good. Let’s do Wednesday at 2 PM.  
Rep: Perfect! I’ll send a calendar invite and a demo agenda.
