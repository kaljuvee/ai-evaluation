Rep: Thanks for connecting today. What prompted you to explore CRM solutions now?  
Prospect: We're struggling with lead tracking and alignment across sales teams.  
Rep: I understand. What challenges are you facing with your current system?  
Prospect: It’s not user-friendly and doesn't integrate well with our marketing tools.  
Rep: Got it. If we could streamline lead management and improve integration, how would that impact your sales process?  
Prospect: It would save us time and help close deals faster.  
Rep: What’s your budget for a new CRM, and when do you aim to implement it?  
Prospect: We have around $10,000 allocated this quarter, and we want to roll it out by next month.  
Rep: Are there specific features that are must-haves for your team?  
Prospect: Yes, we need robust reporting and mobile access.  
Rep: Our solution offers those features and integrates with major marketing platforms. Any concerns?  
Prospect: Just the time needed for training and data migration.  
Rep: We can provide training sessions and support during migration. How about starting with a demo next week?  
Prospect: That sounds good. Let’s schedule it for Wednesday.  
Rep: I’ll send the invite and a checklist of what we’ll cover. Next step: follow up after the demo.
