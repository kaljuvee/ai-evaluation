Rep: Thanks for meeting today. What challenges are you facing with your current CRM system?  
Prospect: We're struggling with data management and lead tracking. It's hard to get a clear view of our pipeline.  
Rep: I understand. What specific features do you feel are missing?  
Prospect: We need better reporting and integration with our marketing tools.  
Rep: Got it. If those features were improved, how would that impact your sales team’s performance?  
Prospect: We could close deals faster and improve follow-up, which is crucial for us.  
Rep: What’s your budget for a new CRM solution?  
Prospect: We have around $20,000 allocated this quarter.  
Rep: That fits well with our pricing. Have you evaluated any competitors?  
Prospect: Yes, we've looked at Salesforce, but the complexity is a concern.  
Rep: Our solution is user-friendly and tailored for quick adoption. Would a demo next week work for you?  
Prospect: Yes, let’s do that. I’ll involve my sales manager.  
Rep: Great! I’ll send a calendar invite for the demo and a brief agenda. Next step: follow up after the demo for feedback.
