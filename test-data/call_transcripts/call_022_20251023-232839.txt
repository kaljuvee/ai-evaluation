Rep: Thanks for taking the time today. What challenges are you facing with your current CRM?

Prospect: We're struggling with lead tracking and data silos. It's hard to get a clear view of our pipeline.

Rep: I see. How are you currently managing your sales processes?

Prospect: Mostly through spreadsheets and manual entry, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.

Rep: If we could streamline your lead management and provide real-time insights, what would that help you achieve?

Prospect: We'd close deals faster and improve collaboration among teams.

Rep: Do you have any budget constraints for a new CRM solution?

Prospect: We allocated some funds, but I need to justify the ROI to our CFO.

Rep: Understood. How does your team currently evaluate CRM options?

Prospect: We typically compare features and ask for demos. Our last vendor didn’t meet our integration needs.

Rep: Our CRM offers seamless integration with tools like HubSpot and Salesforce. Would a demo next week work for you?

Prospect: Yes, let’s do that. 

Rep: I’ll send a calendar invite for the demo. Next step: gather your team’s requirements.
