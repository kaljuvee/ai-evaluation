Rep: Thanks for meeting today. What challenges are you facing with your current CRM?  
Prospect: Our sales reps find it clunky, and we’re missing leads. It’s slowing down our pipeline.  
Rep: I see. What specific features do your reps struggle with the most?  
Prospect: The lead tracking and reporting tools are outdated and hard to use.  
Rep: If we could simplify those processes, what would that mean for your team’s productivity?  
Prospect: It would save us time and help us close deals faster.  
Rep: Do you have a budget in mind for a new solution?  
Prospect: We’re looking at around $10,000 for the year.  
Rep: Our solution starts at $8,000 and includes onboarding support. Are there any other stakeholders involved?  
Prospect: Yes, my COO will want to see ROI projections.  
Rep: We can provide case studies showing improved close rates. Would a demo next week work for you?  
Prospect: Sure, let’s do Wednesday.  
Rep: Perfect, I’ll send a calendar invite and a brief overview of our solution.
