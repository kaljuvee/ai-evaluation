Rep: Thanks for connecting today! What prompted you to explore new CRM solutions?

Prospect: Our current system isn’t scalable, and we’re losing leads due to inefficiencies.

Rep: That’s a common concern. Can you share more about your lead management process?

Prospect: We’re relying heavily on spreadsheets and manual entries. It’s overwhelming.

Rep: I understand. What specific features would help streamline that process?

Prospect: Automation for follow-ups and better reporting would be key.

Rep: Great! What does success look like for your sales team in the next quarter?

Prospect: If we could increase our lead conversion by 20%, that would be ideal.

Rep: Are there any budget constraints we should be aware of?

Prospect: We have around $15,000 allocated this quarter, but we’re open to options.

Rep: Competitive tools like HubSpot are popular, but our automation is more robust. Any hesitations on moving forward?

Prospect: Just worried about data migration.

Rep: We offer dedicated support for that process. Would a demo next week work for you?

Prospect: Yes, let’s schedule it for Thursday.

Rep: Perfect! I’ll send the invite. Next step: prepare for the demo.
