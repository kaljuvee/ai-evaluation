Rep: Thanks for chatting today. What challenges are you facing with your current CRM system?  
Prospect: Our team struggles with lead tracking and reporting. It’s manual and slow.  
Rep: I understand. How does this impact your sales cycle?  
Prospect: We miss follow-ups, and leads slip through the cracks. It’s frustrating.  
Rep: What would an ideal solution look like for you?  
Prospect: Automated reminders and real-time dashboards. We need to speed things up.  
Rep: Any budget constraints we should consider?  
Prospect: We have a budget for this quarter, but it’s tight.  
Rep: Understood. Are you evaluating other CRMs?  
Prospect: We’re looking at Salesforce and HubSpot.  
Rep: Our CRM integrates seamlessly with both, but we focus on ease of use and support. Any concerns preventing a decision?  
Prospect: Just the transition and training.  
Rep: We offer full onboarding support. How about a demo next week?  
Prospect: That sounds good. Let’s do Wednesday.  
Rep: Perfect! I’ll send a calendar invite and prepare a tailored demo.
