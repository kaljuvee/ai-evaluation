Rep: Thanks for connecting today! What challenges are you facing with your current CRM solution?  
Prospect: We're struggling with lead tracking and reporting. It’s too manual and slow.  
Rep: I understand. How are those issues impacting your sales team's performance?  
Prospect: It’s causing missed opportunities and frustration. We need better visibility.  
Rep: What features would you say are critical for your team to improve productivity?  
Prospect: Automated lead scoring and real-time analytics would help a lot.  
Rep: Does your current CRM provide those?

Prospect: We have about $15,000 for this quarter.  
Rep: Great! We can provide a tiered plan starting under that. How about a demo next week?  
Prospect: That sounds good. Let’s aim for Wednesday.  
Rep: I’ll send a calendar invite and prepare a tailored demo. Looking forward to it!
