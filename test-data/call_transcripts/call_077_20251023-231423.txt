Rep: Thanks for meeting today. What challenges are you facing with your current CRM system?  
Prospect: It’s not user-friendly, and our sales team spends too much time inputting data.  
Rep: I see. What features do you think would improve their productivity?  
Prospect: Automation for follow-ups and better reporting tools.  
Rep: Great. If you could achieve those improvements, what would success look like in three months?  
Prospect: Higher sales velocity and more accurate forecasting.  
Rep: What’s your budget for a new CRM?  
Prospect: We're looking to stay under $10,000 annually.  
Rep: Understood. Have you considered other CRM options?  
Prospect: Yes, Salesforce, but it seems too complex for us.  
Rep: Our platform offers simplicity with powerful automation. Any concerns that might hold you back?  
Prospect: Just the migration process.  
Rep: We can support a phased rollout to ease the transition. How about a demo next week?  
Prospect: Sounds good. Let’s schedule it for Wednesday.  
Rep: I’ll send a calendar invite. Next step: gather your team for the demo.
