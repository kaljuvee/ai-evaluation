Rep: Thanks for meeting today. What challenges are you facing with your current CRM system?  
Prospect: We're struggling with lead tracking and integration with other tools. Our team spends too much time on data entry.  
Rep: I understand. How are these issues impacting your sales process?  
Prospect: We're losing leads because responses are delayed. Plus, team morale is low with all the manual work.  
Rep: If we could automate lead tracking and improve integration, what would that mean for your team?  
Prospect: It would definitely speed up our follow-ups and improve conversion rates.  
Rep: Do you have a budget allocated for a new CRM?  
Prospect: We can allocate around $15,000 this quarter.  
Rep: Great. Are there any competitors you’re considering?  
Prospect: We've looked at HubSpot and Salesforce, but they seem expensive.  
Rep: Our solution offers similar features at a lower price point with easier integrations. Would a demo next week work for you?  
Prospect: Yes, let’s do that. Also, I’d like my team to join.  
Rep: Perfect! I’ll send a calendar invite for Tuesday and include them.
