Rep: Hi, thanks for meeting today! What prompted you to explore a new CRM solution?

Prospect: Our current system is outdated and lacks integration with our sales tools. 

Rep: I see. What specific features are you looking for in a new CRM?

Prospect: We need better lead tracking and reporting. Our team spends too much time on manual data entry.

Rep: Understood. If we could automate lead tracking and provide real-time analytics, how would that change your sales process?

Prospect: It would definitely speed things up and help our reps focus more on selling rather than data entry.

Rep: Great! What’s your budget range for a new CRM?

Prospect: We have about $15,000 allocated for this year, but we need to see ROI quickly.

Rep: Understood. Are there any competitors you’re considering?

Prospect: We’ve looked at Salesforce and HubSpot, but they seem pricey.

Rep: Our solution is more affordable and offers seamless integration. How about a demo next week to show you how it can fit into your existing workflow?

Prospect: That sounds good. Let’s schedule it for Wednesday.

Rep: Perfect! I’ll send a calendar invite and confirm the details. Looking forward to it!
