Rep: Thanks for connecting today! What prompted your interest in a new CRM solution?  
Prospect: We’re struggling with lead tracking and reporting across teams. It's becoming chaotic.  
Rep: I understand. What specific features are you looking for to improve that?  
Prospect: Automated lead assignment and better analytics would be huge for us.  
Rep: Great! What does success look like for your team in six months?  
Prospect: More visibility into the sales pipeline and improved conversion rates.  
Rep: Any budget constraints we should consider?  
Prospect: We’re looking at around $10,000 for a solution that fits our needs.  
Rep: That’s helpful. Have you evaluated other CRM products?  
Prospect: Yes, we looked at HubSpot but found it a bit pricey for what we need.  
Rep: Our pricing is competitive and includes those features. Would a demo next week to show these capabilities work for you?  
Prospect: Yes, that sounds good. Let’s also involve our sales manager.  
Rep: Perfect! I’ll set up the demo for Thursday and send a calendar invite. Next step: gather requirements with your sales manager before then.
