Rep: Thanks for meeting today! What challenges are you facing with your current CRM system?  
Prospect: We're struggling with lead tracking and the integration with our marketing tools.  
Rep: I see. How is that impacting your sales team’s productivity?  
Prospect: They spend too much time entering data instead of selling.  
Rep: If we could streamline data entry and improve lead visibility, how would that change your results?  
Prospect: It’d boost our conversion rates significantly, I believe.  
Rep: What’s your budget for CRM solutions this quarter?  
Prospect: We're looking at around $10,000 for implementation.  
Rep: Have you looked at other solutions?  
Prospect: Yes, but they seem either too complex or too pricey.  
Rep: Our solution offers a user-friendly interface and competitive pricing. Would you be open to a demo next week?  
Prospect: Yes, I’d like to see how it compares.  
Rep: Great! I’ll send over a calendar invite. Next step: gather your team for feedback after the demo.  
Prospect: Sounds good, I'll get them involved.
