Rep: Thanks for taking the time today. What challenges are you facing with your current CRM system?  
Prospect: We're struggling with lead tracking and data integration across teams. It’s impacting our sales cycle.  
Rep: I understand. How do you currently manage lead handoffs?  
Prospect: It’s mostly manual, leading to lost opportunities.  
Rep: If we could streamline that process and improve conversion rates, what would that mean for your team?  
Prospect: A 20% increase in conversions would be huge for us.  
Rep: Are there any budget constraints we should keep in mind?  
Prospect: We have a budget, but we’re also evaluating a couple of competitors.  
Rep: Which competitors are you looking at?  
Prospect: HubSpot and Salesforce.  
Rep: We offer more customization and better integration at a lower cost. Would a demo showing our integration capabilities help?  
Prospect: Yes, that would be useful.  
Rep: Great! Let’s schedule a demo for Thursday. I’ll send a calendar invite and a brief agenda.  
Prospect: Sounds good. Looking forward to it!
