Prospect: Automated follow-ups and integration with our email platform are key.  
Rep: Great. What would success look like in the next quarter?

Prospect: We have a budget of $10,000 for this quarter.  
Rep: Competitors often mention integration challenges. Is that a concern for you?  
Prospect: Yes, especially with our existing tools.  
Rep: Our CRM has seamless integrations. How about a demo next week to explore this?
