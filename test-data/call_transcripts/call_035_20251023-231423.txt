Rep: Thanks for connecting today. What challenges are you facing with your current CRM?

Prospect: We're struggling with data visibility and tracking leads effectively. It feels scattered.

Rep: I hear you. What specific features are you missing that would help your sales team?

Prospect: We need better reporting and integration with our email platform. It’s hard to keep everything aligned.

Rep: Understood. If you had those capabilities, what would that improve for your team?

Prospect: We could close deals faster and better nurture leads, ultimately increasing our revenue.

Rep: Any budget constraints I should be aware of?

Prospect: We have around $15,000 allocated for this quarter, but it needs to show ROI quickly.

Rep: That’s reasonable. We typically see a 20% increase in sales productivity within three months. Any concerns about switching CRMs?

Prospect: Just the learning curve. Our team is already busy.

Rep: We offer comprehensive training and support during the transition. How about a demo next week?

Prospect: That sounds good. Let’s schedule it for Thursday morning.

Rep: Perfect. I’ll send a calendar invite and a demo agenda. Next step: prepare your team’s key questions for the demo.
