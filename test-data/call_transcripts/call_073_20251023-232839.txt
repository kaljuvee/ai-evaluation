Rep: Thanks for connecting today. What challenges are you facing with your current CRM solution?  
Prospect: We're struggling with data accuracy and slow reporting. It’s impacting our sales forecasting.  
Rep: I understand. Can you share how your team currently uses the CRM for reporting?  
Prospect: We rely on manual entries, which leads to discrepancies.  
Rep: What would an ideal reporting process look like for you?  
Prospect: Real-time updates and automated insights would be great.  
Rep: Absolutely. Any budget considerations we should keep in mind?  
Prospect: We have some flexibility, but I'd need to justify ROI to the CFO.  
Rep: Understood. Are you considering any other CRM solutions?  
Prospect: Yes, we looked at Salesforce, but found it too complex for our needs.  
Rep: Our platform offers simplicity and strong analytics. How about a demo to see it in action?  
Prospect: That sounds good. Can we include my sales manager?  
Rep: Of course! I’ll set up a demo for next Wednesday and send a calendar invite.  
Prospect: Perfect, looking forward to it!
