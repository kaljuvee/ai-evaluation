Rep: Thanks for connecting today, [Prospect's Name]. What’s driving your interest in a new CRM solution?  
Prospect: Our current system is too clunky and doesn't integrate well with our sales tools.  
Rep: That’s frustrating. Which specific tools are you currently using?  
Prospect: We rely heavily on email and a sales automation tool, but there's a lot of manual data entry.  
Rep: I see. What would an ideal CRM look like for your team?  
Prospect: Seamless integration, automated reporting, and improved lead tracking.  
Rep: Understood. What’s your timeline for implementing a new CRM?  
Prospect: We’re hoping to have something in place within the next quarter.  
Rep: Do you have a budget allocated for this?  
Prospect: Yes, around $15,000.  
Rep: Great! Are you evaluating any other CRM providers?  
Prospect: We’re looking at Salesforce and HubSpot, but they seem pricey.  
Rep: Our solution is competitive in pricing and offers strong integration capabilities. How about a demo next week?  
Prospect: Sounds good. Let’s do Tuesday at 10 AM.  
Rep: Perfect. I’ll send a calendar invite and a list of features we’ll cover.
