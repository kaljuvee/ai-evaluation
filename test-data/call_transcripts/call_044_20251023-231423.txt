Rep: Thanks for connecting today. What challenges are you facing with your current CRM system?  
Prospect: We're struggling with lead tracking and integration with our marketing tools. It’s causing delays.  
Rep: I understand. How do you currently manage lead assignments?  
Prospect: Mostly manual. It creates bottlenecks and missed opportunities.  
Rep: If we could streamline lead tracking and automate assignments, what would that mean for your team?  
Prospect: It would boost our conversion rates and save us a lot of time.  
Rep: Any budget constraints for a new CRM?  
Prospect: We have a budget set for this quarter, but we need to see clear ROI.  
Rep: Understood. Are you considering other CRM solutions?  
Prospect: Yes, we've looked at Salesforce and HubSpot, but they seem too complex for our needs.  
Rep: Our CRM offers intuitive features and seamless integration. How about a demo next week to explore this?  
Prospect: That sounds good. Let’s schedule it for Wednesday.  
Rep: I’ll send a calendar invite and a brief overview. Next step: review your current workflow.
