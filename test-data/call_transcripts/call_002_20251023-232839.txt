Rep: Thanks for meeting today. What challenges are you facing with your current CRM?  
Prospect: We’re struggling with data management and tracking sales performance effectively.  
Rep: I see. How are you currently tracking your sales team’s activities?  
Prospect: Mostly spreadsheets, which are cumbersome and prone to errors.  
Rep: If we could streamline your data in real-time and provide better insights, how would that impact your team?  
Prospect: It would definitely improve our forecasting and help us hit targets more consistently.  
Rep: Any budget constraints we should consider?  
Prospect: We have a set budget for this quarter, but I need to justify the ROI to the CFO.  
Rep: Understood. How does your team currently compare CRM solutions?  
Prospect: We’ve looked at a couple, but they seem more focused on small businesses.  
Rep: Our CRM is designed for scalability. What’s your timeline for implementation?  
Prospect: Ideally within the next month.  
Rep: Let’s schedule a demo next week to show how we can meet your needs. Does Thursday work?  
Prospect: Yes, that works for me.  
Rep: Great! I’ll send a calendar invite and follow up with some case studies.
