Rep: Thanks for meeting today. What prompted you to explore CRM solutions right now?  
Prospect: Our current system is outdated and lacks integration with our tools. It’s slowing down our sales process.  
Rep: I see. What specific features are you looking for in a new CRM?  
Prospect: We need better pipeline management and reporting capabilities. Sales forecasting is crucial.  
Rep: Understood. What would success look like for your team in the next quarter?  
Prospect: A streamlined process that boosts sales productivity by at least 20%.  
Rep: Do you have a budget in mind for this project?  
Prospect: We're looking at around $15,000 for the initial setup.  
Rep: Great. Have you considered any competitors?
