Rep: Thanks for connecting today. What challenges are you facing with your current CRM system?  
Prospect: We're struggling with data silos and lack of integration between teams.  
Rep: I see. How are these issues affecting your sales processes?  
Prospect: Our reps spend too much time on admin tasks instead of selling. It's impacting our revenue.  
Rep: If we could automate those tasks and improve visibility across teams, what would that mean for you?  
Prospect: We could boost productivity and close more deals.  
Rep: Great! What's your budget for a new CRM solution?  
Prospect: We have about $20,000 allocated this quarter.  
Rep: Do you have any competitors in mind?  
Prospect: We've looked at Salesforce and HubSpot, but they seem pricey for what we need.  
Rep: Our solution offers robust features at a lower price point. Would you be open to a demo next week?  
Prospect: Yes, a demo sounds good.  
Rep: Iâ€™ll send over a calendar invite. Next step: gather your team for feedback after the demo.
