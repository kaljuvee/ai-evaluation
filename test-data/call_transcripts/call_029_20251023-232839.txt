Rep: I understand. What tools are you using now?  
Prospect: Just spreadsheets and email. It's getting unmanageable as we grow.  
Rep: I see. What would a streamlined process look like for your team?  
Prospect: Ideally, it would automate follow-ups and provide insights on lead engagement.  
Rep: Makes sense. Is there a specific budget you have in mind for a CRM solution?  
Prospect: We’re looking to spend around $10,000 annually.  
Rep: Great, our plans start at $8,000 and include advanced analytics. Have you evaluated any competitors?  
Prospect: We looked at Salesforce, but it felt too complex for our needs.  
Rep: Our platform is user-friendly and customizable. Any concerns about implementation?  
Prospect: Just the time it takes to train the team.  
Rep: We offer onboarding support. How about we schedule a demo next week?
