Rep: Thanks for meeting today. What challenges are you facing with your current CRM?  
Prospect: We're struggling with lead tracking and reporting. It’s cumbersome for the team.  
Rep: I see. What specific features are you looking for to improve those areas?  
Prospect: We need better automation and integration with our marketing tools.  
Rep: Understood. How do you measure success with a new CRM?  
Prospect: Faster lead conversion and clearer reporting would be ideal.  
Rep: Any budget constraints we should consider?  
Prospect: We're hoping to stay under $15,000 annually.  
Rep: That’s doable. Have you evaluated any other CRMs?  
Prospect: We looked at Salesforce but found it too complex for our needs.  
Rep: Our platform is user-friendly and built for quick adoption. Would a demo next week help?  
Prospect: Yes, but I want my sales team involved too.  
Rep: Absolutely, I’ll arrange a demo for your team on Wednesday. I’ll follow up with a calendar invite.  
Prospect: Sounds good. Looking forward to it!  
Rep: Great! I’ll send over the details shortly.
