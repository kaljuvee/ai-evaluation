Rep: Thanks for connecting today! What challenges are you facing with your current CRM system?  
Prospect: We’re struggling with lead tracking and integration with our marketing tools. It’s really slowing us down.  
Rep: I understand. How are these issues impacting your sales team’s performance?  
Prospect: They’re spending too much time on manual data entry instead of selling.  
Rep: If we could streamline lead tracking and improve integration, what would that mean for your team?  
Prospect: It would boost our conversion rates significantly.  
Rep: Any budget constraints we should consider?  
Prospect: We have a budget for this quarter, but it’s tight.  
Rep: I see. Our solution starts at $50 per user per month, with a 20% discount for annual commitments. Does that fit into your plans?  
Prospect: It might, but I need to compare it with our current provider.  
Rep: Totally understandable. We can set up a demo next week to show how we compare. How does that sound?  
Prospect: Sounds good. Let’s schedule it for Wednesday.  
Rep: I’ll send a calendar invite and demo details. Next step: gather your team’s feedback after the demo.
