Rep: Thanks for taking the time today. What prompted you to explore new CRM solutions?

Prospect: We're struggling with lead management and tracking sales activities effectively.

Rep: I understand. Can you share what tools you’re currently using and their limitations?

Prospect: We're using a basic tool, but it lacks integration with our email and calendar, which causes delays.

Rep: Got it. What specific features would make a CRM valuable for your team?

Prospect: Automated follow-ups and better reporting capabilities would be huge for us.

Rep: Great. What does success look like for your sales team in the next few months?

Prospect: Increased lead conversion rates and more accurate forecasting.

Rep: Any budget constraints we should consider?

Prospect: We have about $10,000 set aside for this quarter, but we need to see ROI quickly.

Rep: Our platform integrates well with existing tools and offers a free trial. Would that alleviate concerns?

Prospect: A trial sounds good, but we’re also looking at competitors.

Rep: I can arrange a demo next week. If we can meet your needs, we can discuss a trial. How does that sound?

Prospect: That works. Let’s set up the demo for Wednesday. 

Rep: I’ll send a calendar invite and a proposal outline. Next step: follow up after the demo.
