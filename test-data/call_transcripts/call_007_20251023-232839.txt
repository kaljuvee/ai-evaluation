Rep: Thanks for taking the time to chat today. What challenges are you currently facing with your sales processes?  
Prospect: We're struggling with tracking leads effectively and managing follow-ups. It’s all over the place.  
Rep: I see. What systems do you have in place right now?  
Prospect: We use spreadsheets and an old CRM, but it’s not really cutting it.  
Rep: Understood. What specific features are you looking for in a new CRM?  
Prospect: Automation for lead tracking and reporting, plus integration with our marketing tools.  
Rep: Got it. How important is mobile access for your team?  
Prospect: Very important; our reps are often on the road.  
Rep: We offer a mobile app with complete functionality. What’s your budget for this solution?  
Prospect: We can allocate around $10,000 for this quarter.  
Rep: That aligns well with our pricing. Any concerns that might hold you back?  
Prospect: Just the transition; we need it to be smooth.  
Rep: We can set up a phased rollout with training support. How about a demo next week?  
Prospect: That sounds good. Let’s do it Wednesday.  
Rep: I’ll send a calendar invite and include a follow-up plan. Looking forward to it!
