Rep: Thanks for connecting today. What’s driving your interest in a new CRM solution?  
Prospect: Our current system is clunky and doesn’t integrate well with our other tools.  
Rep: I see. Which tools are you trying to integrate?  
Prospect: Primarily our email platform and project management software.  
Rep: Understood. What specific features are you looking for in a new CRM?  
Prospect: We need better reporting capabilities and automated follow-ups for leads.  
Rep: That makes sense. What would a successful implementation look like for you in three months?  
Prospect: Increased lead conversion rates and less time spent on data entry.  
Rep: What’s your budget for this project?  
Prospect: We’re looking at around $10,000 for the first year.  
Rep: Competitively, our solution starts at $8,000 annually with full support. Any concerns about switching?  
Prospect: Just the migration process and user training.  
Rep: We offer a dedicated onboarding team to streamline that. Can we schedule a demo next week?  
Prospect: Sure, let’s do Thursday.  
Rep: Perfect! I’ll send a calendar invite and demo details.
