Rep: Thanks for connecting today. What challenges are you facing with your current CRM system?  
Prospect: It’s not user-friendly, and our sales reps are spending too much time on data entry.  
Rep: I understand. What features are most important for your team?  
Prospect: We need better lead tracking and reporting capabilities.  
Rep: Great, how do you currently measure sales performance?  
Prospect: We use spreadsheets, but it's cumbersome and error-prone.  
Rep: If we could streamline reporting and improve data accuracy, how would that impact your team?  
Prospect: It would let them focus more on selling rather than admin work.  
Rep: Any budget constraints we should consider?  
Prospect: We have some flexibility, but I need to justify ROI to the CFO.  
Rep: Our clients typically see a 30% increase in productivity within three months. Any concerns holding you back?  
Prospect: Integration with our existing tools is a worry.  
Rep: We offer seamless integrations. How about scheduling a demo next week?  
Prospect: Sounds good. Let’s do Wednesday.  
Rep: Perfect, I’ll send over the details and a calendar invite.
