Rep: Thanks for connecting today. What challenges are you facing with your current CRM system?

Prospect: We’re struggling with lead tracking and our sales team finds it cumbersome.

Rep: I see. What specific features are causing the most frustration?

Prospect: The interface is outdated, and it doesn't integrate well with our email and marketing tools.

Rep: That makes sense. If we could streamline lead management and improve integration, what would that mean for your team?

Prospect: It would save us time and help us close deals faster.

Rep: Are there any budget constraints we should be aware of?

Prospect: We have a budget allocated for CRM upgrades this quarter, but it’s tight.

Rep: Understood. How does your current CRM stack up against competitors you've considered?

Prospect: We've looked at a couple, but they all seem to lack the customization we need.

Rep: Our CRM offers robust customization options. Would a demo next week help you evaluate it further?

Prospect: Yes, that sounds good. Let’s schedule it for Thursday.

Rep: Perfect! I’ll send a calendar invite and a brief agenda. Looking forward to it!
