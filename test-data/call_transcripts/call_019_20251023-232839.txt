Rep: Thanks for meeting with me today! What challenges are you facing in managing your current sales processes?  
Prospect: We're struggling with tracking leads and ensuring follow-ups. It feels chaotic.  
Rep: That makes sense. How do you currently manage your customer interactions?  
Prospect: We use spreadsheets and email, but it’s hard to keep everything organized.  
Rep: If we could streamline your lead management and automate follow-ups, what would that mean for your team?  
Prospect: It would free us up to focus on closing deals, not just tracking them.  
Rep: Any budget constraints I should be aware of?  
Prospect: We have a budget, but we need to see a clear ROI first.  
Rep: Understood. Are you evaluating other CRM solutions?  
Prospect: Yes, we've looked at Salesforce and HubSpot, but they seem too complex for our needs.  
Rep: Our CRM is designed for ease of use, with quick setup and training. How about a pilot to evaluate it?  
Prospect: That sounds good. Let's start with a small team.  
Rep: Great! I’ll send over the pilot plan and set up a follow-up meeting for next week.
