Rep: Thanks for chatting today. What led you to explore a new CRM solution?  
Prospect: Our current system is clunky and doesn’t integrate well with our marketing tools.  
Rep: That sounds frustrating. Which integrations are you looking for specifically?  
Prospect: We need seamless connections with our email platform and analytics tools.  
Rep: Understood. What would a successful CRM implementation look like for you in the next quarter?  
Prospect: Improved lead tracking and better reporting for the sales team.  
Rep: Any budget considerations we should keep in mind?  
Prospect: We have around $15,000 allocated this quarter.  
Rep: Great, and how does your current system compare in terms of features and pricing?  
Prospect: We’re paying about $10,000 annually, but it lacks mobile access.  
Rep: Our platform offers mobile capabilities and starts at $12,000 annually. Would you have concerns about transitioning?  
Prospect: Just downtime during the switch.  
Rep: We can ensure a phased rollout with minimal disruption. Can we schedule a demo next Thursday?  
Prospect: That works. Let’s do it!  
Rep: I’ll send a calendar invite and agenda. Next step: share user feedback from your team.
