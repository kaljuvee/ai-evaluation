Rep: Thanks for chatting today. What prompted you to explore a new CRM solution?  
Prospect: Our current system is too rigid and doesn’t support our remote sales team effectively.  
Rep: I see. What specific features are you looking for in a new CRM?  
Prospect: Flexibility in customization and seamless integration with our existing tools.  
Rep: Got it. How do these limitations impact your sales process currently?  
Prospect: It slows us down, and we miss out on valuable insights.  
Rep: Understood. What would success look like for your team in the next quarter?  
Prospect: Increased sales productivity and better reporting for management.  
Rep: Any budget constraints you’re working with?  
Prospect: We have a budget set, but we need to see value first.  
Rep: Competitors often highlight our flexibility and integration capabilities. Any concerns?  
Prospect: Just the implementation timeline.  
Rep: We can set up a trial in two weeks to showcase those features. Does that sound good?  
Prospect: Yes, let’s do that.  
Rep: I’ll send over the trial details and schedule a follow-up for next Thursday.
