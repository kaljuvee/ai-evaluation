Prospect: We need seamless connections with our marketing automation and support tools.  
Rep: Understood. What would an ideal CRM help you achieve in the next 90 days?  
Prospect: Improved lead tracking and better reporting to boost sales team performance.  
Rep: Any budget constraints we should consider?  
Prospect: We have a budget for this quarter, but it’s tight.  
Rep: I can share how our solution is more cost-effective compared to Salesforce. Any concerns about switching?  
Prospect: Just the learning curve for the team.  
Rep: We offer onboarding support and training. Would a pilot with a key team member be beneficial?
