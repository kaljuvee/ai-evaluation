Rep: Thanks for taking the call today! What’s driving your interest in a new CRM solution?  
Prospect: Our current system isn’t scaling well with our growing sales team. We need better visibility into our pipeline.  
Rep: I understand. What specific challenges are you facing with visibility?  
Prospect: We struggle with tracking leads and managing follow-ups effectively.  
Rep: Got it. What would a successful CRM implementation look like for you?  
Prospect: Automated tracking, better reporting, and integration with our marketing tools.  
Rep: Are there any budget constraints we should consider?  
Prospect: We have a budget of $15,000 for this quarter, but we need to see clear ROI.
