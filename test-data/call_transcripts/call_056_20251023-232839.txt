Prospect: We struggle with tracking leads and managing customer interactions effectively. Our current system feels outdated.  
Rep: I understand. What specific features are you looking for in a CRM?  
Prospect: We need better reporting and automation for follow-ups.  
Rep: Great. If we could automate your follow-ups and provide real-time insights, how would that impact your team’s productivity?
