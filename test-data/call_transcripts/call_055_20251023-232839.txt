Rep: Thanks for connecting today! What’s driving your interest in a new CRM solution right now?  
Prospect: We're struggling with our current system; it's not user-friendly and lacks integration with our sales tools.  
Rep: I see. What specific features are you looking for to streamline your sales process?  
Prospect: We need better lead tracking and reporting capabilities. Our team relies on spreadsheets, which is inefficient.  
Rep: Understood. What would a successful implementation look like for you in the next three months?  
Prospect: Ideally, a fully integrated system that provides real-time insights and automates follow-ups.  
Rep: Are there any budget constraints we should consider?  
Prospect: We have some flexibility, but we need to justify the investment to the CFO.  
Rep: I can see that. How does your current CRM compare to what we offer?  
Prospect: It lacks customization and is slow. Your reviews seem positive, though.  
Rep: Great to hear! Would a demo next week help you evaluate?  
Prospect: Yes, that sounds good. Let’s schedule it for Wednesday.  
Rep: I’ll confirm the demo and send over a calendar invite. Next step: discuss feedback after the demo.
