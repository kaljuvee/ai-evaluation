Rep: Thanks for taking the call today! What challenges are you facing with your current CRM system?  
Prospect: We’re struggling with lead tracking and pipeline visibility. It’s cumbersome and outdated.  
Rep: I understand. How do you currently measure success in your sales process?  
Prospect: We focus on conversion rates and time to close, but it’s hard to get accurate data.  
Rep: If we could streamline reporting and improve data accuracy, what impact would that have?  
Prospect: It would help us identify bottlenecks and improve our forecast accuracy.  
Rep: Any budget constraints we should consider?  
Prospect: We have some budget flexibility, but it needs to align with our quarterly goals.

Rep: We have a proven integration process. How about we set up a demo next week to show you?  
Prospect: That sounds good. Let’s schedule it for Wednesday.
