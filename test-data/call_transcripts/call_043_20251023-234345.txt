Rep: Thanks for connecting today! What’s driving your interest in a new CRM solution right now?  
Prospect: Our sales team is struggling with tracking leads effectively and managing customer interactions.  
Rep: That’s common. Can you share which processes are the most challenging?  
Prospect: The manual data entry and follow-ups are eating up time. We need better automation.  
Rep: Understood. If you could automate those tasks, what would success look like in three months?  
Prospect: Streamlined lead tracking and higher conversion rates.  
Rep: Any budget constraints we should consider?  
Prospect: We have a budget set for this quarter, but I need to show ROI to the CFO.  
Rep: Do you currently use any CRM platforms?  
Prospect: Yes, we’re on an outdated system that doesn’t integrate well.  
Rep: Our CRM offers seamless integrations and a 30% increase in efficiency. Would a pilot program help demonstrate value?  
Prospect: Yes, but I need to ensure it won’t disrupt our current workflows.  
Rep: We can set up a pilot without affecting your current system. How about a demo next week?  
Prospect: Sounds good. Let’s schedule that.  
Rep: I’ll send a calendar invite for Tuesday and follow up with a demo outline.
