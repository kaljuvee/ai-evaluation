Rep: Thanks for meeting with me today. What challenges are you facing with your current CRM system?  
Prospect: We're struggling with lead tracking and reporting. It's too manual and time-consuming.  
Rep: I see. How does that impact your sales team’s performance?  
Prospect: They spend more time on data entry than selling, which affects our numbers.  
Rep: Understood. What specific features are you looking for in a CRM?  
Prospect: Automated lead scoring and better integration with our marketing tools.  
Rep: Great. What’s your budget and timeline for implementing a new solution?  
Prospect: We have around $10,000 set aside for this quarter, but we need it up and running by Q2.  
Rep: Have you evaluated any competitors?  
Prospect: We’re looking at Salesforce, but it seems overkill for our needs.  
Rep: Our solution can integrate seamlessly with your current tools and is more cost-effective. How about a demo next week?  
Prospect: That sounds good. Let’s aim for Wednesday.  
Rep: Perfect, I’ll send a calendar invite and a demo agenda. Next step: gather your team’s input before the demo.
