Prospect: We're struggling with tracking leads effectively and managing sales forecasts. It’s a bit chaotic.  
Rep: I understand. How do you currently manage your lead pipeline?

Rep: Are there any budget constraints we should consider?

Prospect: We use a few different platforms; it needs to integrate smoothly.  
Rep: We offer seamless integrations with major tools. How about a demo next week to show you the capabilities?  
Prospect: That sounds good. Let’s schedule it for Thursday.  
Rep: I’ll set that up and send a calendar invite. Looking forward to it!
