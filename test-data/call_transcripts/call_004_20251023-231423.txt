Rep: Thanks for connecting today. What challenges are you facing with your current CRM system?  
Prospect: It's not user-friendly, and the sales team struggles with adoption.  
Rep: I see. How do you envision an ideal CRM enhancing your sales process?  
Prospect: It should streamline our pipeline management and improve forecasting accuracy.  
Rep: Understood. What specific features are most critical for you?  
Prospect: Integration with our marketing tools and real-time reporting are key.  
Rep: Any budget parameters we should consider?  
Prospect: We have about $15,000 allocated, but we need to see a strong ROI.  
Rep: Competitors often struggle with integration. How important is that for your decision?  
Prospect: Very. If it doesn't integrate well, we won't consider it.  
Rep: We can demonstrate our seamless integration in a trial. How does a pilot next week sound?  
Prospect: That works. Letâ€™s involve the sales manager too.  
Rep: Great! I'll send over the pilot details and schedule a kickoff for Wednesday.
