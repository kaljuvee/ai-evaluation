Rep: Thanks for meeting today. What prompted your interest in a new CRM solution?

Prospect: Our current system isn’t scaling with our growth. We need better visibility into sales performance.

Rep: That makes sense. What specific features are you looking for to improve visibility?

Prospect: We need real-time reporting and better forecasting tools. The manual processes are slowing us down.

Rep: I understand. What would a successful outcome look like in three months?

Prospect: A streamlined process that allows us to analyze sales data quickly and accurately.

Rep: Any budget constraints we should be aware of?

Prospect: We have a budget, but it needs to show clear ROI within six months.

Rep: Do you have other CRM solutions in mind?

Prospect: We’ve looked at Salesforce and HubSpot, but they seem complex for our needs.

Rep: Our CRM is user-friendly and integrates seamlessly with your existing tools. Any concerns holding you back?

Prospect: Just the implementation timing. We don’t want disruption.

Rep: We can implement in phases. How about a trial period to assess fit?

Prospect: That sounds good. Let’s set it up.

Rep: Great! I’ll send over a trial proposal and schedule a follow-up for next week.
