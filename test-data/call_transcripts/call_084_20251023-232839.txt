Rep: I appreciate you taking the time today. What challenges are you facing with your current CRM system?  
Prospect: We're struggling with lead tracking and integration with our marketing tools. It's all very disjointed.  
Rep: I see. How does that affect your sales pipeline management?  
Prospect: It makes forecasting unreliable. We miss follow-ups and lose potential deals.  
Rep: Understood. What would a successful CRM look like for your team?  
Prospect: Seamless integration, easy lead management, and robust reporting features.  
Rep: Any budget constraints we should consider?  
Prospect: We have about $15K for this quarter but need to justify it to the CFO.  
Rep: Got it. Are there specific competitors you’re looking at?  
Prospect: We’re considering HubSpot and Salesforce, but they seem pricey.  
Rep: Our solution offers competitive pricing with similar features. Would a demo next week work?  
Prospect: Yes, let’s do that. I’d like my sales team to join too.  
Rep: I’ll set that up and send calendar invites. Next step: prepare a tailored demo.
