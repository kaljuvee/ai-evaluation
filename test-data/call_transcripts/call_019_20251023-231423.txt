Rep: Thanks for meeting today. What challenges are you facing with your current CRM solution?

Prospect: We’re struggling with lead tracking and reporting. It’s too cumbersome, and our team is frustrated.

Rep: I understand. What specific features are causing the most frustration?

Prospect: The reporting is manual and takes too long. We need real-time insights to make quick decisions.

Rep: If we could automate those reports and streamline tracking, what would that mean for your team?

Prospect: It would save us time and help us close deals faster. 

Rep: Any budget constraints I should be aware of?

Prospect: We have a budget set for this quarter, but I need to justify the ROI to the board.

Rep: Understood. Have you looked at other CRMs, or are we your first?

Prospect: We’ve considered a couple, but they didn’t meet our needs.

Rep: Our solution offers customizable dashboards and integration with your existing tools. How about a demo next week?

Prospect: That sounds good. Let’s do it Tuesday.

Rep: Great! I’ll send a calendar invite. Next step: prepare a tailored demo for your team.
