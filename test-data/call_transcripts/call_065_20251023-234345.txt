Rep: Thanks for meeting today! What challenges are you facing with your current CRM?

Prospect: Our team struggles with lead tracking and data integration across platforms.

Rep: That’s common. How do those issues impact your sales cycle?

Prospect: We lose leads due to miscommunication and missed follow-ups. It costs us sales.

Rep: If we could streamline your lead tracking and improve data visibility, what would that mean for your team?

Prospect: Faster conversions and better forecasting. 

Rep: Great. What’s your budget range for a new CRM solution?

Prospect: We're looking to stay under $20,000 annually.

Rep: We can work within that. Have you evaluated other CRM solutions?

Prospect: Yes, but they seemed too complex or pricey for what we need.

Rep: Our platform is user-friendly and integrates easily with other tools. What’s your timeline for implementation?

Prospect: Ideally within the next quarter.

Rep: Let’s schedule a demo next week to showcase how it can fit your needs. 

Prospect: Sounds good. Let’s do Tuesday at 2 PM.

Rep: I’ll confirm the demo and send over a calendar invite.
