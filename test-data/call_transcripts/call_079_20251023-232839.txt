Rep: Thanks for connecting today! What sparked your interest in a new CRM solution?

Prospect: We're looking to improve our sales forecasting accuracy. Our current system isn't cutting it.

Rep: I see. What specific challenges are you facing with forecasting?

Prospect: It’s mostly manual data entry, which leads to mistakes. Our reps spend too much time on admin tasks.

Rep: Understood. What would a streamlined process look like for your team in three months?

Prospect: Less time on data entry, automatic updates, and reliable forecasts to share with upper management.

Rep: That sounds impactful. What's your budget for a CRM solution?

Prospect: We have around $15,000 this quarter, but we need to demonstrate value first.

Rep: Do you currently use any integrations that are critical for your sales process?

Prospect: Yes, we rely on email and our project management tool. 

Rep: Our CRM integrates seamlessly with both. Any concerns about switching?

Prospect: Just the time it takes to implement.

Rep: We can run a phased rollout over six weeks. How about a demo next week to show the potential?

Prospect: That works. Let’s do it.

Rep: I’ll send a calendar invite and prepare a demo tailored to your needs. Next step: follow up after the demo.
