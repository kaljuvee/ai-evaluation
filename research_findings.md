# AI Evaluation Frameworks Research Findings

## TrueLens (TruLens)

**Overview**: TrueLens is an open-source library for evaluating and tracking LLM experiments and AI agents. Originally created by TruEra, now shepherded by Snowflake.

**Key Features**:
- Feedback functions for programmatic evaluation
- OpenTelemetry compatibility for interoperable tracing
- Evaluation of critical components: retrieved context, tool calls, plans
- Dashboard for metrics comparison and trace-level analysis
- Support for agents, RAG, summarization, and co-pilots

**Core Evaluation Methods**:
- Groundedness: Ensures answers don't hallucinate beyond retrieved context
- Context Relevance: Measures retrieval quality and relevance
- Answer Relevance: How relevant the answer is to the question
- Coherence: Logical flow and consistency
- Comprehensiveness: Completeness of responses
- Harmful/toxic language detection
- User sentiment analysis
- Language mismatch detection
- Fairness and bias evaluation
- Custom feedback functions

**Installation**: `pip install trulens`

**Use Cases**:
- Agent evaluation and monitoring
- RAG system evaluation
- LLM application performance tracking
- Production monitoring with real-time feedback
