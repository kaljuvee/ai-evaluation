## üìä Multiple Prompt Strategies

We've implemented **7 different prompt versions** for summarization tasks, each with specific characteristics and expected improvements:

### **1. Basic Summarization**
```python
signature = "article_title, article_content -> summary"
```
- **Description**: Simple, direct summarization without additional instructions
- **Expected Behavior**: Model generates summaries based on default understanding
- **Expected Improvement**: Baseline performance

### **2. Detailed Summarization**
```python
signature = "article_title, article_content -> summary, key_points"
```
- **Description**: Requests both summary and key points extraction
- **Expected Behavior**: More structured output with additional insights
- **Expected Improvement**: +10-15% keyword overlap

### **3. Refined Summarization**
```python
enhanced_content = "Please provide a clear, concise summary focusing on the main points."
```
- **Description**: Quality-focused instructions for better summaries
- **Expected Behavior**: More focused summaries with better adherence to requirements
- **Expected Improvement**: +15-20% length appropriateness

### **4. Academic-Style Summarization**
```python
enhanced_content = """Please provide an academic-style summary that includes:
1. Main topic and scope
2. Key findings or arguments
3. Implications or significance
4. Methodology (if applicable)"""
```
- **Description**: Academic-style structured approach
- **Expected Behavior**: More structured summaries with better coverage of academic elements
- **Expected Improvement**: +20-25% content coverage

### **5. Executive Summary Style**
```python
enhanced_content = """Please provide an executive summary that includes:
- Executive overview (2-3 sentences)
- Key points (3-5 bullet points)
- Business implications
- Recommendations (if applicable)"""
```
- **Description**: Business-focused summary for executive context
- **Expected Behavior**: Business-focused summaries with clear structure and actionable insights
- **Expected Improvement**: +25-30% structure quality

### **6. Technical Summarization**
```python
enhanced_content = """Please provide a technical summary that includes:
- Technical concepts and terminology
- Implementation details
- Technical challenges and solutions
- Performance metrics (if applicable)"""
```
- **Description**: Technical detail emphasis
- **Expected Behavior**: Technically detailed summaries with better coverage of technical aspects
- **Expected Improvement**: +30-35% technical accuracy

### **7. Comparative Analysis Summary**
```python
enhanced_content = """Please provide a summary that includes:
- Main content summary
- Comparison with related technologies/concepts
- Advantages and disadvantages
- Market or industry context"""
```
- **Description**: Context and comparison focus
- **Expected Behavior**: Summaries with broader context and comparative analysis
- **Expected Improvement**: +35-40% contextual relevance

## üîç Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics

We've implemented **5 detailed evaluation metrics** with comprehensive explanations and weighted scoring:

### **1. Exact Match (30% weight)**
```python
def exact_match_metric(gold, pred, trace=None):
    return gold.expected_summary.lower().strip() == pred.summary.lower().strip()
```
- **What it measures**: Perfect word-for-word matching between expected and predicted summaries
- **Why it matters**: Ensures precise replication of expected output
- **High scores indicate**: Exact replication of target summaries

### **2. Length Appropriate (20% weight)**
```python
def length_metric(gold, pred, trace=None):
    gold_length = len(gold.expected_summary.split())
    pred_length = len(pred.summary.split())
    min_length = gold_length * 0.5
    max_length = gold_length * 1.5
    return min_length <= pred_length <= max_length
```
- **What it measures**: Whether summary length is within 50% of expected length
- **Why it matters**: Ensures summaries are neither too short nor too long
- **High scores indicate**: Appropriate summary length for the content

### **3. Keyword Overlap (30% weight)**
```python
def keyword_overlap_metric(gold, pred, trace=None):
    gold_words = set(gold.expected_summary.lower().split())
    pred_words = set(pred.summary.lower().split())
    overlap = len(gold_words.intersection(pred_words))
    return overlap / len(gold_words) if gold_words else 0.0
```
- **What it measures**: Percentage of important words from expected summary that appear in predicted summary
- **Why it matters**: Indicates semantic similarity and content coverage
- **High scores indicate**: Good coverage of key concepts and ideas

### **4. Content Coverage (20% weight)**
```python
def content_coverage_metric(gold, pred, trace=None):
    title_words = set(gold.title.lower().split())
    summary_words = set(pred.summary.lower().split())
    coverage = len(title_words.intersection(summary_words))
    return coverage / len(title_words) if title_words else 0.0
```
- **What it measures**: How well the summary covers key terms from the article title
- **Why it matters**: Ensures main topics are addressed
- **High scores indicate**: Comprehensive coverage of main topics

### **5. Combined Score**
```python
def combined_metric(gold, pred, trace=None):
    exact = exact_match_metric(gold, pred, trace)
    length = length_metric(gold, pred, trace)
    keyword = keyword_overlap_metric(gold, pred, trace)
    coverage = content_coverage_metric(gold, pred, trace)
    return (exact * 0.3 + length * 0.2 + keyword * 0.3 + coverage * 0.2)
```
- **What it measures**: Weighted combination of all metrics
- **Formula**: `(exact_match * 0.3) + (length * 0.2) + (keyword_overlap * 0.3) + (coverage * 0.2)`
- **Why it matters**: Overall performance indicator

## üîÑ MIPRO Optimization Process

**MIPRO (Multi-stage Iterative Prompt Refinement and Optimization)** works in 4 stages:

### **Stage 1: Bootstrapping**
- Generates multiple candidate prompts from training data
- Creates diverse prompt variations
- Establishes baseline performance

### **Stage 2: Evaluation**
- Tests each prompt on validation set
- Measures performance using defined metrics
- Identifies promising candidates

### **Stage 3: Refinement**
- Iteratively improves the best prompts
- Combines successful elements
- Optimizes prompt structure

### **Stage 4: Selection**
- Chooses optimal prompt configuration
- Validates on final test set
- Deploys optimized model

### **MIPRO Implementation**
```python
# Create MIPRO optimizer
optimizer = dspy.MIPROv2(
    metric=combined_metric,
    max_bootstrapped_demos=4,
    max_labeled_demos=2
)

# Optimize the model
optimized_model = optimizer.compile(base_summarizer, trainset=train_examples)
```
